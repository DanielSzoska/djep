Apps

This project has been implemented and maintained each year (first as part of
the PyConDE conference series and starting in 2014 also for the EuroPython
conference of that year) in phases aligned with the respective conference
milestones.

For each of these phases we created a separate app described in the following
chapters:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   apps/proposals
   apps/reviews
   apps/schedule
   apps/attendees

There also exist a handful of supporting apps that either represent the basis
of the phase-apps or provide global functionality for the website used
throughout the site:

   apps/conference
   apps/search
   apps/events
